> **Stop guessing. Start knowing. Every bug. Every risk. Every fix — before you ship.**
> *🎉 Latest Release: **[v1.2.0]** — See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for full version history.*

**PyAuditor** is a standalone desktop application that performs deep, two-layer analysis of any Python codebase. It combines **25-rule AST-based static analysis** with an innovative **"Bring Your Own AI" (BYOAI)** prompt generator to surface not just what will crash — but what *will go wrong*, and *why*, and *exactly how to fix it*.

Built for developers who demand zero ambiguity in their code quality.

## ✨ Two Layers of Analysis

### ⚡ Layer 1 — Static Scan (Instant, Offline)
Parses every `.py` file into an Abstract Syntax Tree and runs 25 specialised rules. No code is executed. Results in under 2 seconds for thousands of lines.

### 🤖 Layer 2 — AI Prompt Generator (Bring Your Own AI)
Generates an optimised, context-rich prompt wrapping your codebase. Paste it into ChatGPT, Claude 3.5, or Gemini to detect **logical errors** that no static rule can find, without worrying about API limits or privacy:
- Wrong comparison operator (`>` when `<` was intended)
- Wrong variable used (`width * width` instead of `width * height`)
- Logic contradicting comments/docstrings
- Off-by-one errors, wrong algorithms, missing edge cases

---

## 🎯 Severity Levels

| Level | Colour | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 🔴 **CRITICAL** | Red | Will crash or produce fatal failure at runtime |
| 🟡 **WARNING** | Yellow | Runs but does the *wrong* thing silently |
| 🟠 **POTENTIAL** | Orange | Works today — time-bomb for the future |
| 🔵 **INFO** | Blue | Code quality & maintainability suggestions |
| 🟣 **LOGIC** | Purple | AI-detected logical errors (wrong behaviour, no crash) |

Every single finding includes:
- **Detail** — exactly what is technically wrong
- **Risk** — what happens at runtime if ignored (concrete scenario)
- **Fix** — exact, actionable instruction to resolve it

## 📋 Requirements

- **Python 3.11+** (uses `str | None` union syntax)
- **Windows / macOS / Linux** — pure `tkinter`, no platform lock-in
- **No third-party packages required** for static analysis
- **No API Keys needed** — Use your favorite LLM via the web interface

---

## 🚀 Installation & Usage

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oguzemirtopuz/PyAuditor.git
cd PyAuditor
```

### 2. Run the application

```bash
python auditor_app.py
```

That's it. No `pip install`. No virtual environment. No setup.py.

### 3. (Optional) Run an AI Audit

1. Select the files you want to analyze in the UI
2. Click **📋 COPY AI PROMPT**
3. Paste the copied prompt into **ChatGPT**, **Claude**, or **Gemini**
4. The AI will instantly return a structured report of any logical errors!

### 4. Auto-Updating

Whenever a new version of PyAuditor is released, you don't need to re-download or use `git pull`. Simply run:

```bash
python update.py
```

This will automatically securely download the latest version, backup your existing files, and apply the update while protecting your local settings and history.

## 🛠️ Rule Catalogue (25 Static Rules)

### 🔴 Critical — Async & Concurrency
| Rule ID | What it detects |
|---------|----------------|
| `asyncio_lock_race` | `asyncio.Lock` lazy-init race condition |
| `blocking_in_async` | `time.sleep` / `requests.get` inside `async def` *(Smart AST: ignores `run_in_executor` scopes)* |
| `missing_await` | Coroutine called without `await` — silently does nothing |
| `syntax_error` | File cannot be parsed by Python |

### 🟡 Warning — Safety
| Rule ID | What it detects |
|---------|----------------|
| `bare_except` | `except:` catches `SystemExit` and `KeyboardInterrupt` |
| `except_pass` | `except: pass` — error silently swallowed |
| `mutable_default_arg` | `def f(x=[])` — shared mutable default |
| `shadow_builtin` | Variable named `list`, `dict`, `str`, etc. |
| `os_exit_bypass` | `os._exit()` skips all Python cleanup |
| `dead_parameter` | Parameter declared but never used in body |
| `unused_self_attr` | `self.x` assigned in `__init__` but never read |
| `widget_not_packed` | Tkinter widget created but never laid out |
| `duplicate_list_items` | Duplicate constants in a list literal |

### 🟠 Potential — Future Risks
| Rule ID | What it detects |
|---------|----------------|
| `magic_number` | Unexplained numeric literal in comparisons/assignments |
| `todo_fixme` | `TODO` / `FIXME` / `HACK` / `BUG` comments |
| `hardcoded_path` | Absolute filesystem path (`C:\...`, `/home/...`) |
| `print_statement` | `print()` call bypassing the logging framework |
| `broad_exception_catch` | `except Exception` without re-raise |
| `multiword_stopword` | Space-separated stop word that can never match a tokenizer |
| `stale_log_value` | Log message references a threshold not present in code |

### 🔵 Info — Design & Quality
| Rule ID | What it detects |
|---------|----------------|
| `long_function` | Function longer than 80 lines |
| `deep_nesting` | 4+ levels of `if`/`for`/`while` nesting |
| `missing_type_hint` | Public function missing parameter or return type |
| `missing_docstring` | Public class or function missing docstring |
| `long_line` | Line longer than 120 characters |
| `unused_import` | Import never referenced in the file |

## ⚙️ Key Features

- **Dark-mode GUI** — professional dark theme with colour-coded severity rows
- **Interactive detail panel** — click any finding to see full Detail / Risk / Fix
- **Filter by severity** — show only CRITICAL, or only LOGIC, etc.
- **Copy for AI** — one click copies a finding in AI-ready format for Claude/Gemini/GPT
- **Open in Editor** — double-click any finding to jump to that exact line in VS Code, or any custom editor
- **Save TXT Report** — export the full report as a portable text file
- **Scan history** — each scan is saved; trend indicator shows improvement vs. last run
- **Rule toggles** — enable/disable individual rules or whole categories
- **Zero-config** — works on any Python project, no configuration files needed

## 🔑 Bring Your Own AI (BYOAI) Advantage

Why we removed direct API integration:
- **No API Limits/Rate Limiting:** You don't have to wait or pay for API credits.
- **Privacy First:** You manually control which code goes to the AI.
- **Model Freedom:** Want to use Claude 3.5 Sonnet for its coding excellence? Or ChatGPT for its reasoning? Just paste the prompt. The generated system prompt strictly coerces *any* modern LLM to reply in the exact PyAuditor JSON format.

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [ ] JavaScript / TypeScript support (Tree-Sitter based)
- [ ] Severity threshold configuration (e.g. fail CI if CRITICAL > 0)
- [ ] GitHub Actions integration
- [ ] Diff mode — show only *new* findings vs. previous scan
- [ ] Export to JSON / HTML report
